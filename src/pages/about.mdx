<h1 class="text-center"> Hi I'm Colton! </h1>

I'm an open source software developer working on global water data
infrastructure for the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/)'s Center for Geospatial Solutions.

In my spare time I am interested in the Linux accessibility ecosystem and like listening to audiobooks.

Feel free to reach out on my [contact](/contact) page
