<h1 class="text-center text-2xl">Accessibility Software Consulting</h1>

I have been developing and personally using a variety of software tools like
voice control and screen readers for over 6 years on a wide variety of
platforms. I would love to help you or your team with your personal or
professional accessibility goals. I have provided software consulting
services for accessibility and UX teams at Github Inc. as well as
personalized sessions for professionals dealing with health challenges in a
wide variety of industries like software, education, or engineering. 

## I can help you no matter if you are:

- an individual with a health challenge like carpal tunnel or vision impairment looking to quickly get the best set
up for personal needs 
- a team leader or educator looking to support a
colleague or student 
- a researcher looking to better understand computer
accessibility 
- a developer looking to better understand screen readers or
voice control tools from a technical perspective Sessions can be as long or
as short you need. 

Not sure if your needs fit my services, reach out
anyways! I am flexible!
