<h1 class="text-center text-2xl">Accessibility Software Consulting</h1>

I have been developing and personally using a variety of accessibility software tools like
voice control and screen readers for over 6 years on a wide variety of
platforms. I would love to use this experience to help you or your team with your personal or
professional accessibility goals. 

<h2 class="p-8 text-center"> I have helped a wide variety of users including: </h2>

- individuals with chronic pain working in tech, academia, finance, and many other industries looking for general advice on their work setup while dealing with a health challenge
- UX researchers at large tech companies like Github Inc.
- experienced software developers looking for technical insight on the accessibility stack
